title: Other effects
---

Starting with version 0.8.0, Weaver does no longer offer out-of-the-box support for other effect types
than cats-effect.

We (maintainers) are happy to keep the core of weaver effect-agnostic, in an effort to allow for third party
to resurrect support for the effect types they use in repository they control.

You can read about the rationale for decision [here](https://github.com/disneystreaming/weaver-test/discussions/570). Feel free to ping us via a github discussion, if you want to tackle.

If you are looking for documentation of them maintenance branch of weaver that did support other effect types, you can find it [over there](https://disneystreaming.github.io/weaver-test/docs/0.6.15/installation).
